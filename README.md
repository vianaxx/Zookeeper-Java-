# Zookeeper-Java-

This Java program simulates viewing different animal habitats based on user input. Users can choose a habitat number to see the description of the corresponding animal habitat. The program uses a `Scanner` to accept user input and displays the selected animal habitat description.

## Features

- Allows users to choose a habitat number to view the description of the corresponding animal habitat.
- Handles invalid input gracefully and displays a farewell message when the user chooses to exit.
- Provides descriptions for various animal habitats, including camel, lion, deer, goose, bat, and rabbit.

## Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository containing the Java file (`Main.java`).
2. Make sure you have Java installed on your system.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where `Main.java` is located.
4. Compile the Java file using the following command:

    ```sh
    javac Main.java
    ```

5. Run the compiled program using the following command:

    ```sh
    java Main
    ```

6. The program will prompt you to enter the number of the habitat you would like to view. Enter a valid number and press Enter.
7. Follow the prompts to view different animal habitats or exit the program.

## Notes

- Make sure you have Java properly installed and configured on your system.
- The program uses a loop to continuously prompt the user for input until the user chooses to exit.
- If the user provides an invalid habitat number or enters non-integer input, the program handles it and provides an appropriate message.
- The program includes descriptions for camel, lion, deer, goose, bat, and rabbit habitats. You can customize these descriptions by modifying the `animals` array.
